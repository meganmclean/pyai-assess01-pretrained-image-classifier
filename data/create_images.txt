Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: Yes.


2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: The ResNet and VGG models correctly classified the two images as the same breed (pug, pug-dog) but the AlexNet classified Dog_02 as a magpie.


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: Yes.


4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer: Both the VGG and ResNet models classified all four images correctly.
So, if basing a decision on the results of the classification of the uploaded image data set only, either would suffice. 
It should be noted that ResNet was significantly faster than VGG (~113ms vs ~510ms). So, if speed is important, ResNet may be the better choice.
If taking the larger data set into consideration, the VGG model is the better choice provided accuracy is more important than speed.
