Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: Yes.


2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: The ResNet and VGG models correctly classified the two images as the same breed (pug, pug-dog) but the AlexNet classified Dog_02 as 'magpie'.


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: Yes.


4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer: 
- If I were to base my decision purely on the outcomes from the uploaded_images data set I would choose the ResNet model. 
  Despite the VGG and ResNet models both classifying all four images correctly, ResNet is significantly faster than the VGG model (approx. 510ms vs 113ms, respectively).
- However, the results from the larger data set indicate the VGG model is more accurate than the ResNet model. 
  Therefore, if I were to take the results of the larger data set into consideration and, assuming accuracy is more important than speed, I would choose the VGG model.
